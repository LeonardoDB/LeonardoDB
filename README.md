# Hi, I'm Leonardo Dalbosco! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leonardo, but you can call me Leo. As a computer scientist and Full Stack developer with experience in web and mobile development, i have a passion for creating innovative technology solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible. I am well-versed in the latest and most current technologies, and i'm always on the lookout for new developments in the field.

Aside from my work in technology, I'm also an avid enthusiast of finance, investments, artificial intelligence, and sports. I believe that a well-rounded individual is better equipped to navigate the challenges of our ever-evolving world. When I'm not working on exciting new projects, you'll find me reading up on the latest investment strategies, studying the newest developments in AI, or cheering on my favorite sports teams.
